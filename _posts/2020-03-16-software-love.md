It's been a scary week. Like many of you, I've been dealing with sudden work and family changes regarding school closings, working remotely and, of course, the changing economic landscape. My schedule has been completely thrown for a loop. 

But I still have a desire to keep busy and feel useful. I love working with teams that are passionate about building software. If your team or business needs help with software development, managing or transitioning to remote software development, I am available and happy to chat.

At Vitreo, I have worked with and managed remote software teams and projects for over a decade. Working remotely comes with unique challenges, but also some real benefits for technology teams. With the right tools and processes in place, it can actually help streamline your delivery process.
