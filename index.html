            <h5>Migrate your applications to cloud-based infrastructure in a predictable, standardized way.</h5>
            <p>One of our clients was feeling the pain of outdated infrastructure, a growing application portfoio
            and a hodge-podge of deployment tactics used by their developer. <strong>They needed to scale, 
              but didn't want to just "forklift" their current problems into the cloud.</strong>  
            <p>We helped them analyze and document their current infrastructure and map out a cloud
            migration strategy that would minimize disruption during the process.
            </p>
            <p>In addition, we helped them identify best-of-breed tools and processes to standardize the
            way they build, integrate, and deploy their applications, even across different programming languages and 
            platforms.  Standardizing and automating much of their software delivery pipeline allowed disparate teams
            to follow a common process and understand how their work integrated with their entire application portfolio.

            <p>For one of our clients in the real estate industry, their photos are by far their most
              important asset for marketing. Their agents upload high resolution images which
              are used all over the web, and viewed by customers all over the world. Their home-grown
              solution was bursting at the seams, and they knew they needed to move to a cloud-based
              solution that could grow along with them.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Using the cloud offerings from Amazon Web Services, we updated their photo management and delivery
              systems to store all their images in the cloud, to generate all the sizes they need from retina displays 
              to thumbnails using a Content Distribution Network to enable fast image delivery globally.</strong> 
            </p>
            <p>
              Our system used Elastic Beanstalk, Cloudfront, S3, and AWS Lambda to create a completely scalable

              enable their employees world-wide to log in once and have seamless access to
              all the applications, services, and APIs they use on a daily basis.

              Leveraging open source and <a href="">Open ID Connect</a> - a standard identity

              built and deployed a customized solution that integrated with our client's Active
              Directory servers to allow their employees to use their corporate logins to access
              resources from anywhere.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>We helped them update a variety of ASP.NET, PHP, and Node.js applications - even
              some of their partners' applications - to use the Single Sign-On service as the primary point
              of authentication</strong>. We were able to securely give each application only the information
              it needed, while saving their employees the hassle of maintaining multiple logins
              and separate accounts.
